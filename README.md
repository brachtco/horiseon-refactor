# horiseon-refactor

##Description

This is the HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon website. Horiseon requested a refactoring of the cod,
and this is the completed refactor. 

Horieson wanted the code to follow accessiblity standards and optimized for search engines (SEO rankings).

We changed the title from website to Horiseon. The three images were missing the alt attributes,
so we added them for those who may be visually impaired and for search engines. The final div on the HTML
page with a class of footer was changed to the footer tag, and we changed it in the CSS. We also changed the heading
tag in the footer from h2 to h4, as it put the headings out of order. They now fall in sequence: h1,h2,h3,h4.
We confirmed and found semantic HTML elements that followed a logical structure.
